# How to Write, Debug, and Test Smart Contracts

> SmartContracts are the programmatic way to determine what transactions are written to the blockchain. There are many ways to write these in Hyperledger Fabric today. Understanding how to design, develop, test, and deploy SmartContracts can be difficult to do correctly.

IBM Blockchain Platformâ€™s Visual Studio Code extension makes the creation of SmartContracts easy by streamlining the process of developing, testing, and deploying a local Hyperledger Fabric Network.

### Attendees can expect to walk away understanding:

- The theory and importance of SmartContracts with respect to Blockchain operation and security
- Gain an insight into the implications of the multi-language support that Hyperledger Fabric offers today.
- How to quickly develop, demo, and deploy your blockchain application on a local Hyperledger Fabric network using Visual Studio Code
- See how to deploy Smart Contracts onto the IBM Cloud Blockchain Platform.
